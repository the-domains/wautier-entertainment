I am excited to announce that as of today, November 9, 2015, I have accepted a position on the board of directors of Film Green Bay.  In addition to the production of the Green Bay Film Festival, FGB hosts filmmaker workshops, resource databases, screenings, and events designed to encourage the growth of and appreciation for film.

While I have already offered my time and talent as a volunteer on a few occasions, it is an absolute honor to fill an even greater role in the organization.  While some may point out that I am not a heavy consumer of commercial films, anyone who knows me well will tell you how passionate I am about the filmmaking and production process, and that I regularly go out of my way to assist other projects.

I personally believe that video is our greatest communication media.  Whether it is being used as a creative outlet, commercial endeavor, or educational tool, there is no greater way to capture the human experience and share it with the world.

Thank you to all the members of Film Green Bay that unanimously approved my consideration to the board.  I look forward to serving with you all!
